## Slides for Lightning talk Part IV

* Part I, done by Jogi is [here as code](https://github.com/jogi-k/micro-controller-slides) as code and [here as slides](https://jogi-k.github.io/micro-controller-slides): Introduction to MCs, some history including 6502, 80C166, moving via Arduino to Raspi Pico
* Part II, done by Jogi is [here as code](https://github.com/jogi-k/micro-controllers-part2) as code and [here as slides](https://jogi-k.github.io/micro-controllers-part2): Introduction to Micro-Controller learning-platforms, especially Micro:Bit and my favourite Calliope.
* Part III, done by [Felix](https://github.com/fliiiix) is somewhere in Roches repos, I assume at least... : Was talking about ESP32 usage 
* Part IV is this one here
* Part V, done by Jogi, is available somewhere inside Roche as G-Slide, internal usecase for our Testfarm, making a lot of usage of [RubberJogi, Open Source here](https://github.com/jogi-k/RubberJogi) 

## Concrete content ! 

* Like the first and second talk : uses branch gh-pages
* every push recreates the slides and publishes them
* is published to : https://jogi-k.github.io
* to be concrete : to https://jogi-k.github.io/micro-controllers-part4/

## About presenting

* At least for CODE there is the possibility to highlight lines step by step, see ```## Dockerfile``` in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbafromthecold/dockerdeepdive/gh-pages/slides.md
* Animations are also possible, let's check if we can mix Markdown with HTML and JS ..., see 
    * https://github.com/rogeralmeida/revealjs-animated <== looks GOOD
    * https://github.com/Martinomagnifico/reveal.js-appearance  <== not yet checked 
    * Built in to reveal: auto-ANIMATE : https://revealjs.com/auto-animate/
